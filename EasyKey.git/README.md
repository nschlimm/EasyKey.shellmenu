# Get started

To get startet with the full functionality:

1. Install `git` on the command line.
2. Install `git-extras` on the command line.
3. You need a [diff tool](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool) for git on the command line.
4. Start the menu with `bash git.sh` or with `bash path/to/git.sh`
